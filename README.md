# Tryin to Redo yesterday's work 

So I'm trying to push a git repo to Github

The first step that comes to mind is to commit...but we have to add before we commit...to add we have to track by typing git status.

## Git Branching 

so whatever I'm planning to write here should not appear in the master branch and should only show in the future branch.
